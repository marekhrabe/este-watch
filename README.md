> Fast and reliable Node.js files watcher.

- It's fast, because it wraps fs.watch which does not use pooling.
- It's reliable, because it supports only that behavior that works reliable across all OS's.

## Why yet another file watcher?

There are zilions Node.js file watchers. No one is perfect. The most feature rich is probably [gaze](https://github.com/shama/gaze), but it burns CPU because it uses pooling fs.watchFile. 
This watcher uses only fs.watch so it has limited functionality, but it works. And it's fast
even for thousands of files. Read more [here](https://github.com/wearefractal/glob-watcher/issues/1#issuecomment-31232567) and [here](http://tech.nitoyon.com/en/blog/2013/10/10/grunt-watch-slow/).

## Example

```javascript
var esteWatch = require('este-watch');

esteWatch(['foo', 'bar'], function(e) {
  switch (e.extension) {
    case 'js':
      console.log(e.filepath);
      break
    case 'css':
      console.log(e.filepath);
      break;
  }
}).start();
```
